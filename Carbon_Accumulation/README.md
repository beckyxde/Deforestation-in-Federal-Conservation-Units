## Uncertainty In Carbon Cccumulation Potential From Natural Forest Regrowth

Estimates the uncertainty in carbon accumulation potential from natural forest regrowth. Specifically, the uncertainty metric is calculated as the modeled sequestration rate (mean of 100 random forest models) divided by the standard error of the 100 random forest models. Uncertainty is presented as a ratio because areas with higher sequestration rates tend to have high standard errors for their sequestration rates; presenting error as a ratio standardizes the model error by the sequestration rate. Higher numbers represent greater uncertainty in the model. For reference, an error ratio of 0.5 means that the standard error of the random forest models is half as large as the mean output of the models for that pixel. The rate uncertainties were estimated over all forest and savanna biomes.

# Cautions:

. Uncertainty reflects variation across different model runs used to predict the final map of carbon accumulation rates. It does not include all possible sources of uncertainty, including that associated with field plot measurements used to train the model. Therefore, uncertainty estimates should be considered a lower bound.
. Uncertainty is shown across all forest and savanna biomes. Much of this land is either currently forested or is not reforestable. Thus, these uncertainties must be applied and assessed only within locations identified as eligible for natural forest regrowth.
